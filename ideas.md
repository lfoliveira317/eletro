## Idea 1: Industrial Precision (The "Pro" Look)

**Design Movement**: Industrial Minimalism / Brutalism Lite
**Core Principles**:
1.  **Function over Form**: Prioritize clarity, specs, and data density (Amazon-like) but with a cleaner, sharper edge.
2.  **High Contrast**: Use strong contrasts to guide the eye to actions.
3.  **Reliability**: The design should feel sturdy and professional, like the tools being sold.
4.  **Directness**: No fluff, just products and specs.

**Color Philosophy**:
*   **Primary**: Deep Slate Blue (`#1e293b`) - Represents reliability, steel, and professionalism.
*   **Secondary**: Safety Orange (`#f97316`) - Used for CTAs (Buy buttons), mimicking construction safety gear and high-visibility tools.
*   **Background**: White (`#ffffff`) and Light Gray (`#f1f5f9`) for content areas to maintain readability and that "catalog" feel.
*   **Intent**: To evoke the feeling of walking into a well-organized hardware store or browsing a pro-grade catalog.

**Layout Paradigm**:
*   **Dense Grid**: High density product grids, similar to Amazon, but with slightly more breathing room between cards.
*   **Sidebar Navigation**: robust filtering on the left (brands, price, power rating).
*   **Header**: Full-width, dark, utilitarian header containing search and account info.

**Signature Elements**:
*   **Squared Edges**: Buttons and cards have sharp or slightly rounded (2px) corners, avoiding the "friendly" pill shape.
*   **Technical Icons**: Use outlined, precise icons for categories (drills, washers).
*   **Spec Tables**: Prominent data tables for product details.

**Interaction Philosophy**:
*   **Instant Feedback**: Hover states are sharp and immediate (border color changes).
*   **Efficient**: Quick add-to-cart buttons directly on product cards.

**Animation**:
*   **Minimal**: Very subtle transitions (0.1s ease-out) for hover states. No bouncing or floating elements.

**Typography System**:
*   **Headings**: **Roboto Condensed** or **Oswald** (Bold, uppercase for section headers) - mimics shipping crates and labels.
*   **Body**: **Inter** or **Roboto** - Highly legible, standard for ecommerce.

## Idea 2: Modern Home Tech (The "Smart" Look)

**Design Movement**: Clean Modernism / Tech Ecommerce
**Core Principles**:
1.  **Approachable Tech**: Tools are for everyone, not just contractors. Make it look friendly but capable.
2.  **Visual Clarity**: Larger images, less clutter than Amazon, but still information-rich.
3.  **Soft Precision**: distinct geometry but with softer edges.
4.  **Curated Feel**: Even though it's a general store, sections feel curated.

**Color Philosophy**:
*   **Primary**: Teal / Ocean Blue (`#0f766e`) - Represents electricity, water (pressure washers), and modern home appliances.
*   **Secondary**: Electric Lime (`#84cc16`) or Bright Yellow (`#facc15`) for accents/badges.
*   **Background**: Very light cool gray (`#f8fafc`).
*   **Intent**: To position Eletro as a modern retailer for the smart home and DIY enthusiast.

**Layout Paradigm**:
*   **Card-Based**: Distinct cards with subtle drop shadows.
*   **Hero Slider**: Prominent carousel for deals/featured items.
*   **Hybrid Grid**: Mix of standard product grids and larger "feature" blocks.

**Signature Elements**:
*   **Rounded Corners**: 8px-12px radius on cards and buttons.
*   **Gradient Accents**: Subtle gradients on the header or primary buttons.
*   **Badges**: "Best Seller", "New" badges in bright colors.

**Interaction Philosophy**:
*   **Smooth**: Soft transitions on hover.
*   **Zoom**: Image zoom on hover for product details.

**Animation**:
*   **Slide & Fade**: Gentle entry animations for page content.
*   **Scale**: Slight scale up on product card hover.

**Typography System**:
*   **Headings**: **Montserrat** - Geometric and modern.
*   **Body**: **Open Sans** - Friendly and readable.

## Idea 3: The "Blueprint" (The Schematic Look)

**Design Movement**: Technical / Blueprint Aesthetic
**Core Principles**:
1.  **Transparency**: Show the details.
2.  **Grid-Locked**: Everything aligns perfectly to a visible or implied grid.
3.  **Monochrome + Accent**: Mostly black/white/blue with one strong accent.
4.  **Instructional**: The UI guides you like a manual.

**Color Philosophy**:
*   **Primary**: Blueprint Blue (`#2563eb`) or Navy.
*   **Secondary**: Construction Yellow (`#fbbf24`).
*   **Background**: White with subtle grid lines or graph paper texture in specific areas.
*   **Intent**: To appeal to the maker/builder mindset.

**Layout Paradigm**:
*   **Modular**: distinct blocks separated by borders.
*   **Split Screen**: Hero sections often split image/text 50/50.

**Signature Elements**:
*   **Visible Borders**: Thin lines separating all content areas.
*   **Monospaced Accents**: Use monospace font for prices or SKUs.
*   **Line Art**: Use line art illustrations for categories.

**Interaction Philosophy**:
*   **Mechanical**: Buttons depress or shift when clicked.
*   **Toggle**: Switches and toggles for filtering.

**Animation**:
*   **Draw-in**: Lines drawing in borders (subtle).
*   **Snap**: Elements snap into place.

**Typography System**:
*   **Headings**: **Chakra Petch** or **Teko** - Technical, square.
*   **Body**: **Space Grotesk** or **System UI** - Clean, functional.
